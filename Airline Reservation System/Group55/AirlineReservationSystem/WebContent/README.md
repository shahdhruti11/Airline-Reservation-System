# Flight-Reservation-System


The final group project for Principles of Information and Database Management (CS 336).
The project uses JSP, Tomcat, Amazon RDS and MySQL to host an airline reservation system.

The implementation of the project was divided into 4 major parts and we divided the work accordingly:
We had one of our group members helped and supported us grinding the project in the end together. Dhruti worked for all the parts but in the end we decided to split the work equally.
